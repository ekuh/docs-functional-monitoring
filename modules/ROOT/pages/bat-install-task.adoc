The Blackbox Automated Testing (BAT) CLI wrapper is a command line wrapper that you install to execute API tests.

== Prerequisite for Linux and MacOS Systems

Before installing the BAT CLI, ensure that AdoptOpenJDK's OpenJDK 8 is installed on your system.

== Prerequisites for Windows 10 Systems

. Install Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)
+
The instructions are at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10.
. Install Java 8, cURL, and unzip installed in the Linux distribution that you installed in your WSL.
. Add the `bat` executable to your `PATH` environment variable.
.. Open the `~/.bashrc` file (if you are using `bash`) or the `~/.zshrc` file (if you are using `zsh`) for editing. For example, to use the `vi` editor, enter this command:
+
`vi ~/.bashrc`
+
or
+
`vi ~/.zshrc`
.. Add the following line to the end of the file and then save the file:
+
`export PATH=$PATH:~/.bat/bat/bin`

== Procedure

. Run the following command to install the BAT CLI:
+
`curl -o- 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/bat-wrapper/install.sh' | bash`
. Run the command `bat -version` to verify that the BAT CLI is installed.

== What To Do Next
