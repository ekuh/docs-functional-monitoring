You can create monitors that test the endpoints of public APIs that are deployed in CloudHub or anywhere on the Web and accessible by anyone, or the endpoints of private APIs that are deployed in CloudHub and accessible only to people who are in your private network.

== Monitoring the Endpoints of Public APIs

Public APIs are APIs with endpoints that are exposed to the open internet. In API Functional Monitoring (AFM), tests of such endpoints are run by workers that themselves run in public locations. A _public location_ is a region (which you can think of as a resource pool) in CloudHub that is shared with other MuleSoft customers.

The tests in monitors are run on schedules. For a worker to run in a public location according to a schedule, a schedule must be associated with it. A public location can be associated with more than one schedule for more than one monitor.

Before you can run tests from a private location, you must create one, which involves specifying a name and an environment for the worker to run it. The environment must be associated with a VPC and must be the same environment that an API to be tested is deployed in. For example, you might create a private location that you name `myLocation` and set it to run in environment `myEnvironment`. When you choose to run a test in `myLocation`, AFM allocates a worker in `myEnvironment` in Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud.

The following diagram depicts the types of relationship that can exist between monitors, private locations, APIs, and environments. It shows five monitors created in AFM. It also shows a VPC in CloudHub in which there are two associated environments: Environment A and Environment B. In Environment A, there are four private locations and seven APIs being tested. In Environment B, there are one private location and three APIs to be tested. The different line types depict five relationship types.

* *First relationship type (represented by solid black arrows):*
+
Monitor 1 runs on a single schedule. The schedule is associated with Public Location 1. The monitor is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 1 and in public API 2, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs. The two APIs are in a single environment.

* *Second relationship type (represented by dashed green arrows):*
+
Monitor 2 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with the same public location. Monitor 2 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 3 and in public API 4, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs. The two APIs are in a single environment.

* *Third relationship type (represented by dashed-and-dotted blue arrows):*
+
Monitor 3 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with a different public location. Monitor 3 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 5 and in public API 6, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs. The two APIs are in a single environment.

* *Fourth relationship type (represented by dotted orange arrows):*
+
Monitor 4 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with the same public location, though each could be associated with a different public location. Each of the two tested public APIs is in a different environment. One environment could be a test environment, and the other environment could be a production environment. Public API 7 and public API 8 are copies of the same API. Monitor 4 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 7 and the same endpoints in public API 8, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs.

* *Fifth relationship type (represented by dashed, dark blue lines):*
+
Monitor 5 runs on a single schedule, though it could run on two. The schedule is associated with Public Location 2. Monitor 5 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 9 and in public API 10 (though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs), both of which are accessible on the World-Wide Web.

=== Length of Time Before Tests Time Out

To prevent tests run in public locations from consuming too many resources, AFM prevents tests from waiting longer than 120 seconds for a response from an endpoint. You cannot increase this wait time.

=== Scheduling Tests

Tests are run at fixed intervals that you define in schedules. Each test is associated with a schedule. When you run tests against the endpoints of public APIs, AFM sets limitations on the following aspects of scheduling:

Number of Schedules::
+
Initially, AFM lets your organization in Anypoint Platform run up to five workers across public locations at one time. Therefore, you can run up to five tests of the endpoints in public APIs at one time.
+
The number of workers that are running tests at any particular time is determined by the schedules that you associate with tests. Across the monitors that are created in AFM in your organization, there can be only five schedules. If you reach the limit and want to run more tests simultaneously, contact your MuleSoft administrator about raising your maximum.

Duration of Intervals Between Executions of Tests::
+
The shortest interval at which you can schedule a test to be run is fifteen minutes.

== Monitoring the Endpoints of Private APIs

Private APIs are APIs with endpoints that are accessible only within your network. API Functional Monitoring lets you monitor private APIs if you have a subscription to Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). With VPC, you can run workers in CloudHub in a virtual, private, and isolated network segment, rather than in a region in which resources are shared.

A _private location_ is a worker that runs in an instance of VPC that is configured to allow workers to access your private network. AFM can create workers within VPC that can run tests against APIs that are accessible only within the network that VPC is configured for. You can create multiple private locations in a single VPC.

The tests in monitors are run on schedules. For a private location to run according to a schedule, a schedule must be associated with it. A private location can be associated with more than one schedule for more than one monitor.

Before you can run tests from a private location, you must create one, which involves specifying a name and an environment for the worker to run it. The environment must be associated with a VPC and must be the same environment that an API to be tested is deployed in. For example, you might create a private location that you name `myLocation` and set it to run in environment `myEnvironment`. When you choose to run a test in `myLocation`, AFM allocates a worker in `myEnvironment` in Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud.

The following diagram depicts the types of relationship that can exist between monitors, private locations, APIs, and environments. It shows five monitors created in AFM. It also shows a VPC in CloudHub in which there are two associated environments: Environment A and Environment B. In Environment A, there are four private locations and seven APIs being tested.

* *First relationship type (represented by solid black arrows):*
+
Monitor 1 runs on a single schedule. The schedule is associated with Private Location 1. The monitor is written to test one or more endpoints in private API 1 and in private API 2, though it could also test endpoints in more private APIs. The private location and the APIs are all in a single environment.

* *Second relationship type (represented by dashed green arrows):*
+
Monitor 2 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with the same private location. The private location is shared with the schedule that runs Monitor 1. Monitor 2 is written to test one or more endpoints in private API 3 and in private API 4, though it could also test endpoints in more private APIs. The private locations and both APIs are all in a single environment.

* *Third relationship type (represented by dashed-and-dotted blue arrows):*
+
Monitor 3 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with a different private location. Monitor 3 is written to test one or more endpoints in API 5 and in API 6, though it could also test endpoints in more private APIs.

* *Fourth relationship type (represented by dotted orange arrows):*
+
Monitor 4 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with a different private location. Each private location is in a separate environment. One environment could be a test environment, and the other environment could be a production environment. Private API 7 and Private API 8 are copies of the same API. Monitor 4 is written to test one or more endpoints in private API 7 and the same endpoints in API 8, though it could also test endpoints in more private APIs.


=== Length of Time Before Tests Time Out

Because tests are run in a VPC, the workers do not share resources with other MuleSoft customers. Therefore, AFM allows tests to wait for a default of thirty minutes for a response from an endpoint. You can increase this time in Runtime Manager.

// What are the exact steps for increasing the time?

=== Scheduling Tests

When you use private locations, you can run as many workers as your allotment of vCores allows. Each worker consumes 0.2 vCores. Therefore, MuleSoft does not limit the number of schedules that you can create for tests that are run from private locations.

Also, you can run tests from private locations at shorter intervals, with the shortest interval being five minutes.
