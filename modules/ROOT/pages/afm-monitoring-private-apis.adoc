Private APIs are APIs with endpoints that are accessible only within your network. API Functional Monitoring lets you monitor private APIs if you have a subscription to Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC). With Anypoint VPC, you can run workers in CloudHub in a virtual, private, and isolated network segment, rather than in a region in which resources are shared.

A _private location_ is a worker that runs in a CloudHub environment that is associated with an instance of Anypoint VPC. API Functional Monitoring can create workers within Anypoint VPC that can run tests against APIs that are accessible only within the network that Anypoint VPC is configured for. The APIs must be deployed in CloudHub. You can create multiple private locations in a single instance of Anypoint VPC. You can run tests against a private API only from a private location. However, you can run tests against a public API either from a private location or a public location.

== Definition of "Private Location"
With Anypoint VPC, you can run workers in CloudHub in a virtual, private, and isolated network segment, rather than in a region in which resources are shared. A _private location_ is a worker that runs in a CloudHub environment that is associated with an instance of Anypoint VPC. AFM can create workers within Anypoint VPC that can run tests against APIs that are accessible only within the network that Anypoint VPC is configured for. The APIs must be deployed in CloudHub. You can create multiple private locations in a single instance of Anypoint VPC.

[NOTE]
====
You can also test public APIs by using private locations. Public APIs are APIs with endpoints that are exposed to the internet.

Also, you can test private APIs from public locations if you whitelist the IP addresses of those locations. You might want to test a private API from a public location if you do not want to use vCores on testing private APIs or if you have no vCores available.

In Runtime Manager, add a new rule to the firewall for Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC). The type must be *https.port*, the source must be *Custom*, and the port range 8081. For the source, use an IP address from this list:

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Public Location
|IP Address

|us-east-1
|3.82.89.58

|us-east-2
|3.128.151.139

|eu-central-1
|18.156.106.167
|===

For the steps of adding a rule to a firewall, see xref:runtime-manager::vpc-firewall-rules-concept.adoc[VPC Firewall Rules]

== Association of Private Locations with Schedules
The tests in monitors are run on schedules. For a private location to run according to a schedule, a schedule must be associated with it. A private location can be associated with more than one schedule for more than one monitor.

When you use private locations, you can run as many workers as your allotment of vCores allows. By default, each worker consumes 0.2 vCores. Therefore, MuleSoft does not limit the number of schedules that you can create for tests that are run from private locations.

Also, you can run tests from private locations at shorter intervals, with the shortest interval being five minutes.




== Creation of Private Locations
Before you can run tests from a private location, you must create a private location, which involves specifying a name and an environment for the worker to run in. The environment must be associated with an instance of Anypoint VPC and must be the same environment that an API to be tested is deployed in. For example, you might create a private location that you name `myLocation` and set it to run in environment `myEnvironment`. When you choose to run a test in `myLocation`, AFM allocates a worker in `myEnvironment` in Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All incoming HTTP traffic must be allowed into the environment where a private location is running. If incoming HTTP traffic is blocked, requests sent by a schedule cannot reach the private location, and the location does not run tests.

The following diagrams depict examples of configurations that are supported for monitors, private locations, APIs, and environments.

* First example configuration
+
image::afm-monitor-private-1.png[]
+
A monitor runs on a single schedule that is associated with a private location. The monitor is written to test one or more endpoints in private API 1 and in private API 2, though it could also test endpoints in a larger number of private APIs. The private location and the APIs are all in a single environment.

* Second example configuration
+
image::afm-monitor-private-2.png[]
+
A monitor runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with the same private location. The monitor is written to test one or more endpoints in private API 1 and in private API 2, though it could also test endpoints in a larger number of private APIs. The private locations and both APIs are all in a single environment.

* Third example configuration
+
image::afm-monitor-private-3.png[]
+
A monitor runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with a different private location. The monitor is written to test one or more endpoints in private API 1 and in private API 2, though it could also test endpoints in a larger number of private APIs.

* Fourth example configuration
+
image::afm-monitor-private-4.png[]
+
A monitor runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with a different private location. Each private location is in a separate environment. One environment could be a test environment, and the other environment could be a production environment. Private API 1 and Private API 2 are copies of the same API. The monitor is written to test one or more endpoints in private API 1 and the same endpoints in API 2, though it could also test endpoints in a larger number of private APIs.

* Fifth example configuration
+
image::afm-monitor-private-5.png[]
+
A monitor runs on one schedule, though it could run on more than one. The schedule is associated with a private location. The monitor is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 1, which is available on the world-wide web, and in private API 2, though it could also test endpoints in a larger number of APIs.

* Sixth example configuration
+
image::afm-monitor-private-shared-location.png[]
+
You can run more than one monitor from a single private location. However, all of the private APIs that are being monitored must be in the same environment as the private location. In this diagram, Monitor A runs from the private location to test a public API, which is accessible on the web, and private API 1, which is in Environment A. Monitor B runs from the same private location, but tests private APIs 2 and 3, which are also in Environment A.


== Length of Time Before Tests Time Out

Because tests are run in an instance of Anypoint VPC, the workers do not share resources with other MuleSoft customers. Therefore, API Functional Monitoring allows tests to wait for a default of thirty minutes for a response from an endpoint. You can increase this time in Anypoint Runtime Manager. To do so, follow these steps:

. Go to Anypoint Runtime Manager.
. Open the settings for the private location for which you want to increase the timeout.
. In the *executionTimeout* field, specify a longer timeout in milliseconds.
