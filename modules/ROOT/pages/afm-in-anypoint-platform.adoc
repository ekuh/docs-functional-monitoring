You can monitor APIs in the *Functional Monitoring* section of Anypoint Monitoring, which you can access from the home page of Anypoint Platform.

To monitor an API means to monitor the performance of its response to requests that are sent to the resources at its endpoints. The *Functional Monitoring* section contains tools for creating a monitor and for uploading a monitor (a test suite written in the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) test-writing language).
