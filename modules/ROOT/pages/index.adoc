API Functional Monitoring (AFM) enables developers and administrators to assure the quality and reliability of APIs that are being used in application networks. AFM enables testing and monitoring of the functional behavior and performance of APIs, throughout the API lifecycle, in testing and production environments.

== Supported Tasks

AFM supports these tasks:

* *Black-box testing:* This type of testing validates the overall behavior of an API and its dependencies.
* *Runtime monitoring:* This type of monitoring ensures that deployed APIs are operating within expected performance in production environments.

You can test and monitor both public and private APIs:

* _Public_ APIs are APIs deployed are accessible by anyone who is connected to the internet.
* _Private_ APIs are APIs deployed in Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud in CloudHub and accessible only to people who are in your private network.

== Monitors

You perform black-box testing and runtime monitoring of APIs by creating monitors. A _monitor_ is a test that is scheduled to run at intervals. It consists of both a test and at least one schedule.

A test consists of:

* One or more combinations of HTTP methods and endpoints
+
For example, in a single test, you might send a request to the endpoint `https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/shuffle/?deck_count=1` by using the HTTP method GET and a request to the endpoint `https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/<<deck_id>>/shuffle/` also by using the GET method.

* One or more assertions
+
By default, the assertion for a test is "Status code must equal 200". However, you can change that assertion and add more. For example, you might add the assertion "Response header Cache-Control must equal `max-age=604800`".

* Optional HTTP request headers
+
By default, no headers are included in requests sent to endpoints. However, you can include any of the headers that AFM supports.


You can get reports on the results of monitor executions.

There are two ways that you can perform functional testing:

* Write tests manually and then schedule them with the Blackbox Automated Testing (BAT) CLI.
+
Test cases are all defined with a common, declarative, and easy-to-use behavior-description language. The language is based on the DataWeave language and follows the “given-when-then” approach to describe behavior in terms of conditions and expected outcomes.
* Create monitors in the *Functional Monitoring* section of Anypoint Monitoring. You can upload as monitors any testing projects that you wrote manually.
