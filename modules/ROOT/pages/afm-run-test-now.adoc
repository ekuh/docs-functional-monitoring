You can run a test on demand without waiting for the current interval of its schedule to elapse. Doing so does not reset the schedule, which continues to count down to the end of the current interval.


== Procedure

. In the list of your monitors, select the monitor that includes the test that you want to run.
. Click the three dots next to the name of the monitor and select *Run Test*.
. Select a location from which to run the test.

== Result

The test runs immediately and the results are displayed after it is finished.
