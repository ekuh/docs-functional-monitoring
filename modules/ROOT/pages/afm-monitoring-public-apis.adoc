Public APIs are APIs with endpoints that are exposed to the open internet. In API Functional Monitoring (AFM), tests of such endpoints are run by workers that themselves run in public locations. A _public location_ is a region (which you can think of as a resource pool) in CloudHub that is shared with other MuleSoft customers.

The tests in monitors are run on schedules. For a worker to run in a public location according to a schedule, a schedule must be associated with it. A public location can be associated with more than one schedule for more than one monitor.

Before you can run tests from a private location, you must create one, which involves specifying a name and an environment for the worker to run it. The environment must be associated with a VPC and must be the same environment that an API to be tested is deployed in. For example, you might create a private location that you name `myLocation` and set it to run in environment `myEnvironment`. When you choose to run a test in `myLocation`, AFM allocates a worker in `myEnvironment` in Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud.

The following diagram depicts the types of relationship that can exist between monitors, private locations, APIs, and environments. It shows five monitors created in AFM. It also shows a VPC in CloudHub in which there are two associated environments: Environment A and Environment B. In Environment A, there are four private locations and seven APIs being tested. In Environment B, there are one private location and three APIs to be tested. The different line types depict five relationship types.

* *First relationship type (represented by solid black arrows):*
+
Monitor 1 runs on a single schedule. The schedule is associated with Public Location 1. The monitor is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 1 and in public API 2, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs. The two APIs are in a single environment.

* *Second relationship type (represented by dashed green arrows):*
+
Monitor 2 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with the same public location. Monitor 2 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 3 and in public API 4, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs. The two APIs are in a single environment.

* *Third relationship type (represented by dashed-and-dotted blue arrows):*
+
Monitor 3 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with a different public location. Monitor 3 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 5 and in public API 6, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs. The two APIs are in a single environment.

* *Fourth relationship type (represented by dotted orange arrows):*
+
Monitor 4 runs on two separate schedules, and each is associated with the same public location, though each could be associated with a different public location. Each of the two tested public APIs is in a different environment. One environment could be a test environment, and the other environment could be a production environment. Public API 7 and public API 8 are copies of the same API. Monitor 4 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 7 and the same endpoints in public API 8, though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs.

* *Fifth relationship type (represented by dashed, dark blue lines):*
+
Monitor 5 runs on a single schedule, though it could run on two. The schedule is associated with Public Location 2. Monitor 5 is written to test one or more endpoints in public API 9 and in public API 10 (though it could also test endpoints in more public APIs), both of which are accessible on the World-Wide Web.

== Length of Time Before Tests Time Out

To prevent tests run in public locations from consuming too many resources, AFM prevents tests from waiting longer than 120 seconds for a response from an endpoint. You cannot increase this wait time.

== Scheduling Tests

Tests are run at fixed intervals that you define in schedules. Each test is associated with a schedule. When you run tests against the endpoints of public APIs, AFM sets limitations on the following aspects of scheduling:

Number of Schedules::
+
Initially, AFM lets your organization in Anypoint Platform run up to five workers across public locations at one time. Therefore, you can run up to five tests of the endpoints in public APIs at one time.
+
The number of workers that are running tests at any particular time is determined by the schedules that you associate with tests. Across the monitors that are created in AFM in your organization, there can be only five schedules. If you reach the limit and want to run more tests simultaneously, contact your MuleSoft administrator about raising your maximum.

Duration of Intervals Between Executions of Tests::
+
The shortest interval at which you can schedule a test to be run is fifteen minutes.
