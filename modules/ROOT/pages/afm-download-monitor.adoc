You can download a monitor and modify its test on your computer. Then, you can either run the test by using the BAT CLI or upload the monitor into the online interface for API Functional Monitoring to create a new monitor.

If you are new to writing tests manually, you can download tests, see how they are structured, and view the content of the files. The knowledge you gain can help you write your own tests.

== Procedure

. Select the monitor from which you want to dowload a test.
. Click the *Tests* tab to see the test versions.
. Click the Download icon for a test version.

== Result

A ZIP file is downloaded to your computer. The filename is `<your Anypoint Platform group ID>_<the name of the monitor>_<the test version>.zip`.
