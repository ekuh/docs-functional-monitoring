You can delete a monitor that you no longer need. However, there is no cost to keeping the monitor if it is not scheduled to run.

== Procedure

. In the list of your monitors, select the monitor that you want to download a copy of.
. Click the three dots to the right of the name of the monitor.
. Select *Delete Monitor*.

== Result

The monitor and all schedules that are associated with it are deleted. The workers that are provisioned for the schedules are all deleted and the resources they are consuming are made available to other workers.
