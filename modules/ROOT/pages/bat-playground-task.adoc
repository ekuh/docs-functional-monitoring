The BAT playground is a web application you can use to familiarize yourself with Behavior Driven Development (BDD) functions. The playground runs tests on the Deck of Cards API by default, but you can tweak commands to experiment and learn about BDD functions by running tests on your API using the BAT playground. In this procedure, you modify the default test, and instead, test the JSONPlaceholder API you designed earlier in this workflow.
